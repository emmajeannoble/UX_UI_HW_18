                        It can be intimidating to start your fitness journey if you donâ€™t already have a trainer or class. The goal of this app is to make it easy and approachable to find the right trainer for you, based on location, focus, and type of workout.

                        <p>
                            The current department of labor website is unwieldy and difficult to navigate. I wanted to restructure the information architecture and navigation to make it easier to find frequently requested items.

                    <p>
                        How do we motivate New Yorkers to volunteer more often? We wanted to warm up the New York Cares site so that it would foster some of the same feelings that volunteering does. The user shouldn't have to look very hard to find a volunteer opportunity.
